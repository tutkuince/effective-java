# Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters
- In short, the telescoping constructor pattern works, but it is hard to write client code when there are many parameters, and harder still to read it.
- In summary, the Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than handful of parameters,
especially if many of the parameters are optional or of identical type.
