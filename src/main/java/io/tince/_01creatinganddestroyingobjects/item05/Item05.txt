# Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

- Static utility classes and singletons are inappropriate for classes whose behavior is parameterized by an underlying resource.

A simple pattern that satisfies this requirement is to pass the resource into the constructor when creating a new instance.
This is one form of dependency injection: the dictionary is a dependency of the spell checker and is injected into the spell checker when it is created.
