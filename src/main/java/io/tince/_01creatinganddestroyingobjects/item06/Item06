# Avoid creating unnecessary objects

- It is often appropriate to reuse a single object instead of creating a new functionally equivalent object each time it is needed.
Reuse can be both faster and more stylish.
- An object can always be reused if it is immutable.

- While String.matches is the easiest way to check if a string matches a regular expression, it's not suitable for repeated use in performance-critical situations.

- Autoboxing blurs but does not erase the distinction between primitive and boxed primitive types.

- The lesson is clear: prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch out for unintentional autoboxing.
