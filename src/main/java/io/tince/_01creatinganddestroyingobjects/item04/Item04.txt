# Enforce noninstanttiability with a private constructor
- Utility classes were not designed to be instantiated: an instance would be nonsensical.
- Attempting to enforce noninstantiabilitiy by making a class abstract does not work.
- A class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.
